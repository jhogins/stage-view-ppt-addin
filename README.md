# Stage View add-in for PowerPoint
This add-in helps stage presenters using large stage displays by providing a separate view of the PowerPoint presentation with the first words of the next slide overlayed at the bottom.

It was built with church worship teams in mind who want to depend on the slides for lyrical prompts without having to worry about the powerpoint controller switching slides with perfect accuracy.

## Installation
This add-in is a work in progress and must first be built via Visual Studio 2019.
Downloadable installers coming soon.

## Requirements
Visual Studio 2019
PowerPoint Plus 2016

It may work on other versions of PowerPoint as well, but it has only been tested on Plus 2016.
